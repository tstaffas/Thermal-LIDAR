# Thermal-LIDAR
Data and code repository for thermal LIDAR

This is a public repository of the data presented in the manuscript entitled: "Interference enhanced thermal light for field trial in photon counting LIDAR"

The data shared are the measured correlation curves with 20 ps wide binsize. The data for the various measurements is recorded in txt files with two columns: time delay and coincidences
